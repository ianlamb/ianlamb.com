## Summary

This was just a fun little project I used to explore some of the many new browser APIs, notably WebRTC which is used to determine your local IP address and also your download speed. It isn't nearly as accurate as a real speed test, but it does a decent job.

## Technology

This React app was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.
