## Summary

This was just a fun little project I used to explore some of the many new browser APIs, notably WebRTC which is used to determine your local IP address. I also tried implementing a network speed test, but not sure if it's very accurate.

## Technology

This React app was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.
