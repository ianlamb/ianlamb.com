## Problem

[Dark Souls](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570940/DARK_SOULS_REMASTERED/) is a punishing fantasy RPG with elements of roguelikes such as predictable move sets and static spawns. This means the more you play and learn the game the easier the encounters become. For this reason, lots of seasoned players enjoy playing through the game quickly and sometimes in new and different ways to change up their experience.

## Solution

The Challenge Run Generator is an app that comes up with randomized "themed" ideas for playthroughs of the game. There are many different ways to artificially modify a playthrough, such as limiting player level or using only a certain type of weapon. Each limitation is given a difficulty weighting and then based on the selected skill level of the player it creates a randomized set of these limitations.

## Technologies

This app uses `jQuery` for dynamically updating the DOM and `bootstrap` as a CSS library.
